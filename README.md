# Winclusive

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub repository that shows you the in's and out's of my Masters in Interactive Media's Thesis called **Winclusive**. This is an iOS application that was developed using Xcode and Swift-Storyboard. 

After some indepth research into iOS development and a focus on autism, I came up with the idea of this application to help promote discussion in the workplace between autistic and non-autistic people. The aim is for a more inclusive environment around autism, disabilities and sensory environment. 

Here you will see how I developed the application that takes on the appearance of a chat/forum system. Individuals using the application can add new dicussion prompts and others can add their comments under this topic.
